RELEASE NOTES
=============
Silicon Labs USBXpress Host SDK for USB bridge products for macOS (OS X)

Package version: 6.7.5
Release date:    2017-05-26

This package is the macOS Software Development Kit (SDK) for Silicon Labs
USBXpress and Classic USB bridge products.  It includes support for the
following products:

* CP2102N   (VCP UART)
* CP2102    (VCP UART)
* CP2104    (VCP UART)
* CP2105    (Dual VCP UART)
* CP2108    (Quad VCP UART)
* CP2110    (HID UART)
* CP2112    (HID I2C)
* CP2114    (USB Audio)
* CP2130    (USB SPI)
* CP2615    (USB Audio)

The SDK is intended for application developers using the above Silicon
Labs products.  The SDK provides interface libraries, header files,
documentation and examples.

This package does not contain the VCP driver or Direct Access
Driver (USBXpress driver).  These drivers can be found in their own
installer packages, downloaded from the Silicon Labs web site.

All host software support for Silicon Labs classic and USBXpress USB bridge
devices has been combined into this single Software Development Kit.
This combined SDK package now replaces the individual, per-device installer
packages.

The SDK is organized according to device.  During installation you can
choose to install support for any or all of the devices.  Each device
directory contains the following subdirectories:

* bin - executables
* include - header files used for compiling programs against the libraries
* lib - libraries and language bindings
* Documentation - Data sheets, application notes, user guides and misc.
* Examples - example programs using the interface libraries

OS VERSIONS
-----------
This package is supported on macOS versions 10.12, 10.11 and 10.10.  It
may work on older versions of macOS (OS X).

INSTALLING
----------
To install the macOS SDK, mount the .dmg and then drag the USBXpressHostSDK 
folder to any place you wish such as your home directory.

UNINSTALLING
------------
Drag the USBXpressHostSDK folder to the Trash.
